# INST630-FinalProject
INST630 - Introduction to Programming for the Information Professional is a course taught at UMD. For the course's final project, we are asked to make a website that displays data gathered using an API or data that is local.  
I chose to make a website that displays weather of interested location, and show different images based on the weather of the location. I made all the assets myself; I drew some of the images myself while the rest are AI generated.
